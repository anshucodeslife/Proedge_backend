# Changelog - Fix Verification Cycle

## Critical Fixes
- **Fixed Server Crash:** Modified `src/services/notification.service.js` to handle missing SMTP credentials gracefully. The server was crashing when trying to create a nodemailer transporter without environment variables.
- **Database Sync:** Executed `prisma generate` and `prisma db push` to ensure the `Notification` model exists in the database.

## Feature Completeness
- **Notification Service:** Added missing `deleteNotification` function to `src/services/notification.service.js`.
- **Email Safety:** Added checks to prevent email sending attempts when transporter is not configured.

## Verification
- **Automated Tests:** Verification script created to test 7 critical endpoints.
- **Manual Validation:** Verified code logic for all failing points.

## Next Steps
- Ensure `.env` has valid SMTP credentials if email features are needed.
- Run `npm start` for production deployment.
